Comparison operators
a == b: a is equal to b
a != b: a is different than b
a < b: a is smaller than b
a <= b: a is smaller or equal to b
a > b: a is bigger than b
a >= b: a is bigger or equal to b
Logical operators
a and b: True if both a and b are True. False otherwise.
a or b: True if either a or b or both are True. False if both are False.
not a: True if a is False, False if a is True.
